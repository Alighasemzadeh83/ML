    "## Introduction to Statistical Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a fundamental method in statistics that allows us to make decisions about population parameters based on sample data. It involves two competing hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: The default assumption, often stating no effect or no difference.\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: The hypothesis we aim to support, indicating a significant effect or difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a test statistic to evaluate these hypotheses, comparing it to a critical value or calculating a p-value to decide whether to reject H₀. Statistical tests can be categorized as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parametric Tests**: Assume the data follows a specific distribution (e.g., normal) and often require known population parameters.\n",
    "- **Non-Parametric Tests**: Make fewer assumptions about the data distribution, suitable for smaller samples or non-normal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will explore four key statistical tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Permutation Test**: A non-parametric test to assess if two datasets come from the same distribution.\n",
    "2. **Chi-Square Test**: A test for categorical data to evaluate goodness of fit or independence.\n",
    "3. **Z Test**: A parametric test for hypotheses about means or proportions with known variance or large samples.\n",
    "4. **Fisher's Exact Test**: A test for associations between categorical variables, ideal for small samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each section includes an introduction, a practical example with Python code, and TODOs for you to complete. These exercises will help you apply the concepts and deepen your understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions for Students\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Complete all TODO sections by writing the necessary code or answers.\n",
    "2. Ensure you have the required datasets (`Occupancy_Estimation.csv`, `StudentsPerformance.csv`, `heart_cleveland_upload.csv`) and adjust file paths as needed.\n",
    "3. Run the code cells to verify your solutions and interpretations.\n",
    "4. Use the theoretical questions to deepen your understanding of each test's purpose and application."

    "The permutation test is a non-parametric method used to determine if two datasets originate from the same distribution.
