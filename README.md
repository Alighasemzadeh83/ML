# Machine Learning
  This repository contains projects, implementations, and experiments from our Machine Learning coursework and competitions taught by Dr. Ali Sharifi Zarchi.

# Topics & Work
  ## Classic Machine Learning
    PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
    KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
    Various optimizers: SGD, Adam, RMSProp, etc.

  ## Neural Networks
    Implementations from scratch and using frameworks
  ## Deep Learning Applications
    MobileNet: implementation & fine-tuning for image tasks
    Image segmentation
    Image colorization
  ## Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    Skip-gram models for translation tasks
    Using BERT and other pretrained language models
    Contrastive learning experiments

# ML Contest
  Participated in a university-wide ML contest featuring three questions across:
  Classical ML,
  Computer Vision,
  NLP

Our team ranked 4th place among all participating teams.
